# Sorting Algorithms Visualization in C++

This project visualizes **multiple sorting algorithms** using C++ and the `graphics.h` library. It provides a **graphical, step-by-step view** of how sorting algorithms work with bars representing array elements, including numeric values on top of each bar.

## Features

- **Supports multiple sorting algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Highlights the **current element** (green) and the **element being compared** (red).  
- Displays **numbers on top of each bar**.  
- Uses **double buffering** for smooth animations.  
- Randomly generates bar heights on every run.

## Screenshots

*Add screenshots of the visualization here: before sorting, during sorting, and after sorting.*

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio)  
- `graphics.h` library (WinBGI) for Windows  

> Make sure `graphics.h` is installed and configured in your IDE.
